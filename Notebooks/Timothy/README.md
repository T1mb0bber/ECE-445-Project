Objectives: Introduce each other on the team and begin to layout project details
What was done: 
We met as a team online to discuss the underlying project that Matthew suggested. With my hardware project experience I set the expectations on how the project flow would be in terms of what amount of time it would take in making our robot. We broke into project roles and some guidelines of how we should work at as a team. Discussed stuff like meetings spots and where our schedules would meet up. I would be responsible for the PCB/electronics, Matthew for the CAD/Mechanical design/Electrical Design, and Ved for the embedded software side.

Objectives: Discuss design and parts strategy
What was done:
We started talking about what the overall shape that Matthew proposed initially. I was consulted with my robotics experience on certain design decisions and I discussed my thoughts with the team. We decided in this meeting on having a 4 motor design to allow for the robot to be able to move in 360 degree rotation at all times. This should allow our robot to be able to move away from a teams weapons. The biggest trade off of our design is the passive vs active weapon structure. We discussed this multiple times and came up with a few more solutions. We thought of possibly adding a middle passive wheel that would move in the center to have some dynamic movement in case a weapon tried to push out our robot. We made this a stretch goal. We started thinking about stm32 vs esp32 microcontroller and what to pick between them. Motors were discussed in terms of brushless vs nonbrushless and we found that they both were quite good. Seems as if both could work on design so we had flexibility in those options. We also pushed to create our RFA earlier so that we could get the extra credit.

Objectives: Begin work on project proposal
What was done:
We began talking about what was required of the project proposals. Three key things were decided in this meeting. We would opt for a esp32 microcontroller for its ease in implementing in hardware and bulit in wireless support on one of the carrier boards. I found a set of motors that I've worked with before that worked quite well. With those two important pieces decided, we can move forward in creating a comprehensive parts list and plan out the hardware sections of our project.
